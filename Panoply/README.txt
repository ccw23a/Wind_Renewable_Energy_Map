  panoply \PAN-uh-plee\, noun: 1. A splendid or impressive array. [...]


INTRODUCTION

  Panoply is a Java application that allows the user to make plots of data from netCDF, HDF,
  and GRIB datasets. Although its strength is in making longitude-latitude (map) plots, it
  can also make other types of georeferenced plots, including keograms and Hovmoeller diagrams;
  general 2D color contour plots; and line plots. Data arrays may be "sliced" from larger
  multidimensional arrays (aka, variables). A large selection of global map projections is
  available for lon-lat figures. Plot images may be saved to disk in bitmap graphic formats
  or in PDF.

  Panoply requires that a Java 11 (or later) Runtime Environment (JRE) be installed on your
  computer. The package manager on some Linux computers will install Java for you if it is not
  already installed. Otherwise you will need to download and install a JRE or a Java Development
  Kit (JDK).


DOWNLOADING

  The current version of Panoply, along with other information about the application, may
  always be found at

INSTALLING AND RUNNING THE "STANDARD" PANOPLY PACKAGE

  The complete Panoply "Generic" package should, after uncompression, includes:

  - Panoply launcher in a shell command file called "panoply.sh".
  - Panoply launcher for macOS in a shell command file called "panoply_macos.sh".
  - Application code files in a folder (sub-directory) called "jars".
  - This README file.

  On most platforms, you may be able to launch Panoply by double-clicking on the Panoply.jar
  icon on the desktop. However, doing so means that Panoply may not be allocated enough
  memory when it is started, in which case it will may not work correctly.

  Instead, you should run Panoply from the shell command line; 'cd' into the directory where
  the above files are located and then type:

  ./panoply.sh

  This should execute a command in the shell file which starts Panoply and requests that it
  be allocated 1 GB of memory. You can increase the memory allocation by editing the
  panoply.sh file and increasing the value specified in the -Xmx option.

  Due to differences in the behavior of "readlink" command as implemented on Linux and on macOS
  Darwin, the panoply.sh script will not work on a Mac. Please use the panoply_macos.sh
  script if you are trying to run this generic version of Panoply from the macOS Terminal.app
  command line.


JAR FILES

  The sub-directory called jars _must_ remain in the same directory as the panoply.sh
  script, and all the "jar" files it holds must remain in the jars sub-directory. These files
  contain the Panoply application code and (re)moving any of them will break Panoply.


OTHER DOCUMENTATION

  More details about Panoply are available at:

    https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/

  There are a few additional installation notes at

    https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/download.html

  We note in particular that the TGZ archive of the "generic" Panoply was created using a BSD
  tar. Uncompressing the archive using a GNU tar will print several unknown-keyword warning
  messages. The uncompressed package should nevertheless be fine.


COLOR TABLES AND CONTINENTS FILES

  Beginning with version 4, Panoply's "standard" selection of color tables and map overlays
  is built into the application. Additional color tables and map overlays may be opened for
  a single session or added to your favorites library for continued use. See the Panoply
  website for for such optional support files.


CONTACT

  Panoply was developed at

  NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies
  2880 Broadway, New York, NY 10025 USA

  Please send bug reports, etc., to Dr. Robert Schmunk at robert.b.schmunk@nasa.gov.

  All bug reports should indicate what version of Panoply you are using as well as what
  operating system and what Java are installed on your computer. Also note that requests
  for assistance opening a dataset or interpreting the gridding of the data within will
  probably require that you provide a copy of the dataset or instructions on where it
  might be downloaded.
